# RL Library

A configurable reinforcement learning library implementing PPO, SAC, DDPG, and more. Designed for ease of use, extensibility, and modularity.

## Features

- **Algorithms**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and more.
- **Custom Environments**: Easily integrate Gymnasium environments or create custom ones.
- **Modular Design**: Separate modules for algorithms, environments, utilities, and configurations.
- **Configurability**: Use YAML files to configure hyperparameters.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for algorithms to ensure reliability.
- **Logging**: Track and visualize training metrics.

## Installation
